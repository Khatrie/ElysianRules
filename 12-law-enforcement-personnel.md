You may not rob any form for law enforcement personnel that are on-duty, unless you are holding them hostage, in that scenario then you are to refer to policy. Taking any equipment aside from that will not be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to theft of police issued weapons and firearms, in order to do this the specific officer has to be full undercover without any form for identifier, or off-duty. Vehicles may be taken with a strong story line associated to them. If you do not have a reason you are stealing the vehicle don't do it.

Being in possession of equipment exclusively available to law enforcement officers will not be tolerated unless the equipment or weaponry is legitimately obtained through robbing undercover or off-duty officers, or if obtained exclusively through some form for server event. Anything aside from this will be considered illegitimate, and will result in penalties issued by government officials.

### 12.03

Impersonation of law enforcement, and / or emergency service personnel is allowed if you have the proper reasoning to be doing so. Impersonating EMS or PD to help a friend out of custody or jail are a small example. Impersonating EMS or PD just to troll others is prohibited
