You may not rob any form for law enforcement personnel that are on-duty, unless you are holding them hostage, in that scenario then you are to refer to policy

10.03, taking any equipment aside from that will not be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to theft of police issued weapons and firearms, in order to do this the specific officer has to be full undercover without any form for identifier, or off-duty.

### 12.02 <a href="#e3p7d5jgackl" id="e3p7d5jgackl"></a>

Being in possession of equipment exclusively available to law enforcement officers will not be tolerated unless the equipment or weaponry is legitimately obtained through robbing undercover or off-duty officers, or if obtained exclusively through some form for server event. Anything aside from this will be considered illegitimate, and will result in penalties issued by government officials.

### 12.03 <a href="#yg0n08nhuc6k" id="yg0n08nhuc6k"></a>

K9 Units will be actual players and NOT NPC’s. You are not to Attack K9 units AT ALL unless they are showing their teeth to attack you as displayed with a “**/me shows teeth to attack”** Upon conclusion of the /me (It Disappears) you are free to attack. Please understand that RP is meant to be an escape from the real world and this is a very touchy subject as a whole, While we do not want to entirely restrict the use of K9 officers it will come at a Per person basis how they want to play them or be around them and will be based per officer and said K9 unit.

### 12.04

Impersonation of law enforcement, and / or emergency service personnel is allowed if you have the proper reasoning to be doing so. Impersonating EMS or PD to help a friend out of custody or jail are a small example. Impersonating EMS or PD just to troll others is prohibited
