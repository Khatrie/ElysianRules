You are to treat the local (PED) population as equals to that of actual players and characters, you are not to walk around shooting and killing locals (PEDS) randomly, it makes little to no sense to do that. Going around killing locals (PEDS) shows a lack of intent, refrain from assaulting and killing them without any necessity to do so.
