Attacking, and / or killing an individual with the reasoning that he or she killed your character off during a scenario where yours died (Had to Re-spawn with E) and could not be saved by EMS, is to be considered revenge killing which is a ban-able offense as you are not supposed to remember what happened if you re-spawn (See 18.01). Exception to this is policy 18.03.
