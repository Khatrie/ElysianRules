You are never to take your own initiative to enforce the server regulations, policies, and / or guidelines if you are not a member of the community staff team. If another individual is in violation with the community policies, then you are to report it to a staff member, whether it be in-game, Discord or the forums. However, you must present evidence in order for actions to be taken against the individual responsible for breaking the rules.

You are not allowed to impersonate members of the staff team in any circumstance, whether it is on the Discord server, forums or within the game itself, doing so will result in an immediate and permanent removal from the server, the community, as well as anything connected and affiliated with it. This is unappealable, as well as non-negotiable due to the severity of the infraction.
