Refrain from using scuba-gear in bank robberies, specifically in a sense where you have it equipped inside the bank, it is unrealistic, as well as the fact that it provides protection to the individual that is not intended for the scuba-gear. Equip the gear upon exiting the vehicle, or within the vehicle rather than within the bank itself.
