Refrain from relaying information that your character has obtained illegitimately, information that your character obtains through outside sources, glitches, or exploits are considered illegitimate, and cannot be used in roleplay, doing so would be considered meta-gaming, and possibly power-gaming depending on whether or not it is obtained through unintended ways.

### 16.02 <a href="#lhqmks9a9ghx" id="lhqmks9a9ghx"></a>

Any information you obtain through external sources such as but is not limited to Twitch, YouTube, Discord, and so forth cannot be used within character as these aspects of communication or flow of information are not considered valid in roleplay as they are not integrated into the city itself, meaning its information obtained outside of character.

### 16.03 <a href="#id-140i3bajz1c0" id="id-140i3bajz1c0"></a>

You are not to use third party communication software such as Discord, TeamSpeak, Skype, and so forth while you are in the city to communicate with others in the city. There are different means for communication which are not limited to seeing the person, Radio, and the cell phone/public phones. We also have a text based phone chat for group messages. Failure to follow this rule will result in immediate disciplinary action if discovered.

Refrain from using communication within a vehicle as a legitimate reason to engage a specific interaction or scenario with someone as they may be whispering, and the windows of the vehicle may be closed, meaning you should not be able to hear what they are communicating, therefore refrain from using it.
