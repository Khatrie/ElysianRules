# 8: Character Development

### 8.01 <a href="#m7ryrn62mykp" id="m7ryrn62mykp"></a>

Characters that you create on the server should take weeks if not months to properly develop, upon flying into the city, you are not some infamous drug lord or the head of some criminal organization or family. Establishing anything remotely close to any of that takes months upon months, and should not be rushed under any circumstance.

Upon initiating interactions and scenarios with other individuals, take some notice of their attributes, furthermore adapt some of them into your own personality if they are fitting, do this to properly develop and evolve your character over time.

Upon first joining the city you are to create a character with a realistic and reasonable first name and last name. Refrain from creating characters with inappropriate or unrealistic names that would be considered unsuitable for a realistic and appropriate storyline and environment. Do not use famous persons or likenesses, you are meant to create your own story, do not play somebody else's. It is also discouraged to use your Discord Gamertag/Username as it can make interactions seem personal when they are not.
