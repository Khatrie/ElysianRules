Upon the creation of a character that you intend to be used for unorganized and / or organized criminal activity, you are to build it in a slow and calculated manner, do not rush to be a mastermind criminal in the matter of days, or some respected gang leader within a few weeks, this should take time, it is unlikely, and unrealistic to believe so.

Allow your character to make connections to learn how criminal activity works within the city, before making any big moves, you need to learn how everything works in advance, be mindful of the attention from law enforcement agencies upon carrying out criminal activities, give yourself and your peers time between your acts. Repeatedly committing criminal offenses will result in longer penalties and fines, as well as the possibility of investigations into yourself, your peers, and whatever organization you may be connected to.

At some point throughout your characterâ€™s storyline, you will come into contact with organized criminals, these criminals had to work their way up, and at some point, this climb can be very important to their storyline. Making connections with these individuals may evolve your story, while some organizations and criminals may work together from time to time, conflict is to be expected at some point.

Territory, resources, consumers, and last of all, power will drive a lot of organized criminal conflicts and activity, both conflicts and cooperation will provide some interest to the storyline, make sure to have a good amount of both, diversity is important in order to keep it enjoyable, avoid large alliances that never allow for any form for conflict, that will eventually make it bland and boring.

Any member added to a criminal organization must be approached through roleplay to make it official, an application or initiation will need to take place, and has to be approved by the person that is in charge of that specific criminal organization. Furthermore, if you ask about your application, or initiation, your chances of getting declined there and then may be high depending on the individual.

Multiple characters from one individual will not be tolerated within the same criminal organization, but also within the same businesses and storyline. Avoid creating several characters within the same storyline, allow each and every one of your characters to be unique, allow them to build a storyline of their own with different interactions, and a different purpose than that of the other.
