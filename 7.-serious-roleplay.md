# 7. Serious Roleplay

### 7.01 <a href="#x7ozqqvluhi6" id="x7ozqqvluhi6"></a>

You are mandated to carry out roleplay scenarios and interactions as realistically as possible. We urge you to remember that your character is a personality within a virtual world with the intention of resembling the real world, therefore your character should be slowly developing and evolving throughout the interactions and scenarios it is presented with.

Refrain from intentionally messing with law enforcement agencies with the intention of baiting them into scenarios, you are to treat them with respect, and you are to act fearful of them considering they are a powerhouse realistically. Furthermore, do not flee from law enforcement over simple traffic violations, do not open fire upon them without appropriate initiation, or reasoning. If it can be dealt with by talking it out. Do so!

### 7.03 <a href="#htey4ga2nucx" id="htey4ga2nucx"></a>

Refrain from encouraging or inciting violence and chaos in scenarios and interactions where it can be resolved peacefully without any form for violence, you should try to avoid getting into trouble with law enforcement, taking the more violent and chaotic paths is more likely to lead you towards negative interactions with law enforcement agencies, use violence as a last resort rather than as a first.
