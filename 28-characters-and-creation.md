### 28.01 <a href="#dn95vopdbcav" id="dn95vopdbcav"></a>

Upon the creation of a character, you are not just putting a name on a model within a game, you are always to consider attributes and traits for the personality of that specific character, and over time, it is your responsibility to take initiative to evolve and build that personality further than that of when it was first created.

When you create your characters, make sure that you give them a few strengths, but at the same time, make sure they have weaknesses as well. Then think about how your character would react to the specifics of those strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the different interactions, scenarios and events he or she is presented with.

What is the background of your characters? Where do your characters come from? This does not necessarily have to be overly detailed, but putting some thought and effort into this aspect will make it easier to roleplay with your characters, it will allow you to build and evolve a story based on the backgrounds of the characters you create.

Remember that you are to stick to the specific personality traits of your characters, you are playing the life of these characters, so the experiences that these characters are presented with should allow for evolution. Allow the different actions, interactions, and consequences to evolve and build your characters over time.

Your character cannot be involved in everything, if there are other avenues of roleplay that you would like to try, then create a new character for the specific avenue that you wish to pursue. One character should not be a lawyer, a judge and then some gang member, that is overkill and unreasonable, therefore it is unrealistic.

Please be mindful of how you enter on-going interactions, scenarios, events, as well as storylines. You can interact with people to see if any opportunity arises, however refrain from showing up out of nowhere to make an impact, or to steer an on-going storyline if your story has not led into the specific event or storyline.

Upon one of your characters reaching a specific destination in their storyline, whether it be failing its intended purpose, or actually accomplishing it, perhaps it is time to consider concluding the storyline of that specific character, and consider new characters you wish to play, and new avenues of roleplay that you wish to explore.
