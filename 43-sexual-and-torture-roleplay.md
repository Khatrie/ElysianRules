Consensual torture RP is allowed, but it is acknowledged as controversial content. It is strictly permitted only when all parties involved have given explicit consent. Participants must openly communicate and agree upon the specific details, boundaries, and limitations of the roleplay before initiating it. Respect for boundaries and limits is essential throughout the scenario. Any violation or non-consensual engagement will result in disciplinary action. Participants hold responsibility for their own well-being.
