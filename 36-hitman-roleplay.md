Refrain from carrying out hitman roleplay, it is not permitted within the server, paid and hired assassins are not allowed due to the fact that it is an excuse to kill other individuals without proper initiation and reasoning in most cases. It will be considered randomly killing other individuals, you may target people through appropriate initiation and reasoning, however you may not put out professional hits for other people. \

Admins reserve the right to Permit scenarios involving Hitman RP if required for the scene at hand.
