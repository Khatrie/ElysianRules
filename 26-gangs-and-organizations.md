# 26: Gangs and Organizations

### 26.01&#x20;

Gangs or Criminal Organizations are groups of individuals bound together by common criminal enterprises, identity, or territory. While organic criminal groups may form, official recognition (which may grant specific server perks or interactions, TBD by Staff) might require registration or approval based on demonstrated quality roleplay, adherence to rules, and established presence. Unofficial groups must still adhere to all server rules, including group size limits outlined elsewhere.

### 26.02&#x20;

Officially recognized gangs may have specific roster limits set by Staff. All gang members must prioritize realistic character development. Gangs wishing to claim specific identifiers (colors, patches, specific clothing items) must do so realistically and avoid interfering with clothing essential for whitelisted jobs or generic civilian wear. Clear identifiers should be worn when actively representing the gang, especially during conflicts.

### 26.03&#x20;

Gangs may attempt to claim territory or exert influence over areas through consistent, high-quality roleplay, not just by declaration. Claiming territory does not grant immunity from law enforcement or other server rules. Disputes over territory should lead to roleplay scenarios, potentially escalating to conflict under the rules outlined below. Respect established areas of influence and initiate RP before encroaching significantly.

### 26.04&#x20;

Gang wars must stem from significant, escalating in-character conflict and roleplay. A clear point of initiation or declaration (communicated appropriately IC, potentially with OOC notification to Staff depending on scale) is required before large-scale, persistent hostilities commence. Random attacks on rival members without prior escalation or specific RP context may be considered RDM.

### 26.05

During active wars, standard rules like Value of Life and NLR still apply. War does not permit blatant RDM or targeting individuals outside the scope of the conflict (e.g., uninvolved friends/family unless they become directly involved). Focus hostilities on rival gang members or specific strategic objectives related to the conflict. Excessive camping of respawn points or businesses solely to disrupt is forbidden.

### 26.06

Wars should have clear RP objectives (e.g., control of a specific racket, territory dominance, revenge for a specific slight). Groups should roleplay towards concluding conflicts, whether through negotiation, achieving objectives, or mutual agreement. Indefinite, non-stop warfare is discouraged and will result in disbandment this is RP, not 100k or die. Staff may intervene if wars become toxic or violate server health.

### 26.07

Gangs may form alliances or rivalries through roleplay. A max of 2 Alliances is allowed. These relationships should be respected. Betrayals are possible but must be rooted in strong RP reasons. Avoid creating massive, server-dominating alliances that stifle all potential conflict and RP diversity.

### 26.08

Recruitment must be done through in-character roleplay. Forcing individuals to join a gang is prohibited. Initiations should be meaningful RP events, not just an OOC invite or prior OOC friendship. One player cannot have multiple characters in the same gang. It is also not realistic to be able to form or join a gang within your first few days within the city. You know nobody and are nobody on the street.

### 26.09

Gang activity will naturally attract LEO attention. Roleplay interactions with LEO realistically, respecting their authority while pursuing your character's criminal goals. Using gang affiliation as an excuse to constantly bait or attack LEOs without reason is prohibited.

### 26.10

Gangs cannot use their status to justify mass RDM, VDM, exploiting game mechanics, breaking NLR, or ignoring other server rules. Gang affiliation does not grant special permission to violate core server policies. Holding city-wide events hostage requires Staff approval.

### 26.11

Gang leaders are expected to guide their members towards high-quality roleplay and ensure adherence to server rules. Leaders may be held accountable for persistent rule-breaking within their group if they are seen to be enabling or ignoring it.\
