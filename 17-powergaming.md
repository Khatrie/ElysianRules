Refrain from roleplaying outside the traits of your specific characters, as well as abusing and using game mechanics and issues that are not supposed to be within the game, or to force an individual into a specific roleplay scenario through the usage of those mechanics, this may be but is not limited to

**17.01.01**

Using your communication or radio equipment while downed upon the equipment being taken away from your character through “/me takes radio and communication equipment”, but also using it while under water, talking while drowned is quite unrealistic if you ask me.

**17.01.02**

Roleplaying your story as if your character has superpowers, or traits and skills that are beyond realistic. Such as but is not limited to not being injured by events that should injure you severely, if not kill you realistically.

**17.01.03**

Failure to use the /me feature to notify someone of something that would be considered noticeable, such as but is not limited to the usage of body cams within character, in that scenario it is only valid if you /me turns on bodycam, phone cam, whatsoever.

**17.01.04**

Refrain from going outside the boundaries of your physical character, if your character is an old individual, then stay true to that, keep physical limitations based on age and otherwise in mind to provide some additional realism into interactions and scenarios.

**17.01.05**

Robbing other individuals without giving them the opportunity to interact or speak, this provides a one-sided roleplay scenario, which should be avoided as we are all here to have a fun and enjoyable time, allowing other individuals to speak and defend themselves rather than forcing them to shut up instantly.

**17.01.06**

Placing individuals into a situation or scenario where there is zero chance for escape or counterplay, such as but is not limited to placing them inside areas through the escort feature while dead or alive in areas where the emergency medical service or other agencies are unable to retrieve them.

Any forms for clothing have to be changed at realistic locations, such as a closet, the back of a vehicle, or within a clothing store, and must not be done to avoid immediate consequences and infractions within roleplay. A few examples of this would be

**17.02.01**

Removing your clothing, or parts of your clothing in the middle of a chase with law enforcement agencies to avoid infractions due to the specific clothing you are wearing, this is unrealistic, and provides no opportunity for counter-play.

**17.02.02**

Removing clothing, or parts of your clothing while downed, how would you get rid of the clothing if you are downed? It would literally be beside you if you were even able to take it off, doing this is borderline no intent to roleplay.
