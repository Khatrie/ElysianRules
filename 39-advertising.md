# 39: Advertising

Refrain from advertising for other servers and communities on the server, whether it is in-game, Discord, forums and so forth, doing so in-game breaks character, and it ruins the player experience, and storylines that they are attempting to build and evolve, doing this will result in a permanent removal from anything affiliated to the community.
