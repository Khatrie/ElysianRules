Any interactions, scenarios, and / or events that occur within the city itself are to remain within the city, and vice versa. Refrain from bringing it outside of the city over grudges and personal feelings. This includes but is not limited to targeting another individual both verbally, and otherwise on the same character, or other characters, or in different locations than the city itself.

Please refrain from fighting fire with fire. This will do nothing but fuel the fire, which means you are effectively allowing the conflict and situation to continue, and evolve. Keep dramatics to a minimum, it is unnecessary and does nothing but cause unpleasant interactions for other individuals. Work your problems out in a civilized and appropriate manner without the need to involve toxicity or the usage of inappropriate language that may negatively affect parties involved.
