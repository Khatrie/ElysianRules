# 40: Evasions

### 40.01 <a href="#qgvxu27hwiv4" id="qgvxu27hwiv4"></a>

Refrain from evading penalties and server suspensions, if a punishment is issued towards your account by a member of the server staff team, then you are to let that penalty play out and expire, evading this punishment will result in a permanent removal from the community, and anything affiliated to it. This is not negotiable in any form or shape. There is a reason the punishment was issued towards you, learn from it rather than attempting to evade it.
