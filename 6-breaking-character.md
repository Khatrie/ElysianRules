Refrain from breaking character on the server, this will not be tolerated as the only result provided by breaking character is negatively impacting a scenario, interaction, incident, or event. The only exception to this specific rule is if a member of the staff team intervenes in a manner where the interaction and / or scenario is temporarily halted due to a report. Anything else will result in an immediate removal from the server.
