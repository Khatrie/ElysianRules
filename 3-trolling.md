Refrain from creating alternate characters with the intention of messing around to negatively affect, or completely grief and ruin the experience and interactions of other players and individuals. This is a serious roleplay community, and we expect everyone to play by those standards at any given time.

Put some effort into appropriately dressing and picking a style for your new character. If you fail to put effort and time into choosing the proper style for your character, then it is doubtful that you will put the proper time and effort into your interactions, roleplay, and storylines.
