# 13: Value of Life

### 13.01 <a href="#ex1nie8j9wik" id="ex1nie8j9wik"></a>

Your character is always mandated to fear for its own life at all times, if someone points a gun at your head, you are to comply with the instructions and demands given by the perpetrator, failure to do so would be considered failure to value your life, which will not be tolerated. An example of this would be one or several individuals pulling up on you with weapons, while you have none brandished or shown.
