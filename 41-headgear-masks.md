### 41.01 <a href="#kzw6tycur7a4" id="kzw6tycur7a4"></a>

Masks and face coverings (including ski masks, balaclavas, etc.) should be worn in realistic contexts. While they are permitted, players should avoid wearing them constantly without justification.

```
Valid Reasons to Wear a Mask:

    Cold weather (e.g., ski masks in snowy areas).

    Motorcycle helmets while riding.

    Occupational use (e.g., medical masks, construction gear).

    Criminal activity (robberies, evading police, etc.).

    Events or scenarios where masks are appropriate (e.g., protests, Halloween).

Unrealistic Use:

    Wearing a mask in everyday situations without reason (e.g., shopping, casual walks).

    Using overly conspicuous or out-of-place masks (e.g., horror masks, gas masks) in normal public settings.
```

Law Enforcement Interaction:\
If you are seen wearing a mask in a suspicious manner, law enforcement may stop and search you. Refusal to comply can lead to further consequences.
