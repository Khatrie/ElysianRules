Any of the terms above are no longer to be used in any form or shape, any and all characters that you create are separate, and are not affiliated in any form or shape, they do not know each other, they are not family members, they play different storylines, refrain from calling another individual out by the fact that you know one of their other characters, do not hint that you know one or several of their other characters, it ruins their roleplay and storyline, treat them as a new person rather than treating them as someone you know.
