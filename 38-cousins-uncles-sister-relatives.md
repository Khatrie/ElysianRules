All characters you create must be completely separate from one another.\
They do not know each other, are not related, and should never be treated as if they share any connection.

**Key Rules:**

* Characters cannot be family members, friends, or associates of your other characters.
* Characters cannot **physically meet in the city** and must act as if the other does not exist at all.
* Do not reference, hint, or call out someone elseâ€™s alternate characters.
* Do not bring knowledge, storylines, or interactions from one character to another.
* Seeing a post on Birdy or hearing something IC does **not** allow your alternate characters to share or act on that information.

Each character should exist with their own independent story, relationships, and progression.\
Treat every new character you meet as a **completely new person**, even if you know the player behind them.

This rule exists to ensure smooth, fair roleplay for everyone and to prevent cross-information sharing.\
Violations will be treated as a serious rule break.
