# 10: Hostages and Kidnapping

### 10.01 <a href="#ytuzaz3odx46" id="ytuzaz3odx46"></a>

Refrain from taking members of law enforcement agencies hostage if there are less than a total of four officers present in the city, there is always going to be more criminals than there are going to be law enforcement officers, therefore it is vital to the player experience that you are fair and reasonable about this.

### 10.02 <a href="#b2g286cdpon3" id="b2g286cdpon3"></a>

Furthermore, you are not allowed to take law enforcement officers hostage without appropriate and reasonable reasonings and motives behind it. Do not take them hostage to take them to a bank robbery in order to get additional demands, this is unrealistic unless you have some form of quarrel with the specific officer. Make sure there is a story building up to it.

### 10.03 <a href="#u2hq5rj5itvg" id="u2hq5rj5itvg"></a>

If you at any point take members of law enforcement agencies hostage while they are on Duty, then you are not allowed to rob them of their police issued equipment or weaponry, the only things that you are allowed to take under that specific circumstance is their radio and communication equipment. Anything else should not be touched or taken.

### 10.04 <a href="#gaxk41hb927h" id="gaxk41hb927h"></a>

Refrain from holding several individuals for a time period of 45 minutes or more, the only exception to this is if the scenario lasts to such an extent, otherwise you are mandated to release them as you are effectively holding them indefinitely. Get a new batch of hostages in the future if your scenario does not go as planned rather than stealing time from individuals to such an extent. Refer to policy 14.7.

### 10.05 <a href="#id-9o5aqvflcedm" id="id-9o5aqvflcedm"></a>

Any individuals taken hostage by individuals with weapons or firearms are to comply with the demands and instructions given by the hostage takers, the same principle goes for members of law enforcement agencies as well, in this scenario they are to fear for their lives.
