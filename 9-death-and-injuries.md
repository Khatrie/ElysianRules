Upon being downed or killed, you are to act appropriately as if you are either dead, unconscious or injured depending on the severity of the injuries presented, furthermore you are to refrain from speaking fluently as if you are perfectly fine, if you are shot and injured by a firearm, then act accordingly, if you are hit unconscious, then act as if you are unconscious for a certain amount of time.

Refrain from leaving hospitals and medical facilities in a normal manner as if you have not been injured previously, your injuries would not magically heal realistically, medical personnel have provided you with the necessary support to get you going, but you are still injured. If you have just gone through a surgery, then act accordingly depending on the severity of the surgery, and injuries that you were presented with.

You are not allowed to force injuries on another individual, you are to communicate injuries and medical checks through **/me**, forcing injuries provides the interaction with a one-sided scenario where the other part is not able to be a part of it, providing them with the chance to communicate their own injuries rather than forcing it upon them.
