# 37: Loopholes

### 37.01 <a href="#id-4m91ru24z3yl" id="id-4m91ru24z3yl"></a>

If you are confronted by members of the community staff team regarding a possible violation of the community policies, you are not to take any initiative to get around that rule as it is written by attempting to use a loophole in the policies, doing so is nothing but foul and toxic, and will result in a removal from the server. We urge you to use common sense, and to show common decency towards staff members, and fellow community members, we expect you to take accountability for your own actions, and your own usage of words.
