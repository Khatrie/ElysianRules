### 25.01 <a href="#g5ruzvoeelea" id="g5ruzvoeelea"></a>

Avoid guns and / or highly illegal weaponry to injure someone for petty things. Firearms are high risk weapons, and are not to be flashed around as if they are toys, use simpler things such as fists, knives and / or other smaller weapons for lower priority situations.

### 25.02 <a href="#id-194s7pv8lqkd" id="id-194s7pv8lqkd"></a>

Avoid using weaponry and / or items and objects that may severely injure another individual for jokes, this is a serious roleplay server, you are to use any and all equipment and / or weaponry sparingly, and with reasoning and proper initiation, use your common sense.

### 25.03 <a href="#jc6b9jfhjzc4" id="jc6b9jfhjzc4"></a>

There is no such thing as rubber bullets on the server, if you use any of your firearms on another individual, you are shooting them with lethal rounds, not rubber rounds, so refrain from killing them to then take them to the hospital to then keep doing it. Exceptions to this are approved events, and specialized circumstances such as law enforcement training.
