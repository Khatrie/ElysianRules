# 15: Scamming & Phishing New Players

### 15.01 <a href="#id-5sn76kp2zfjv" id="id-5sn76kp2zfjv"></a>

Scamming in the city is permitted up to **$20,000** (Items AND Cash Combined Value). However, you are not allowed to intentionally target new players to scam them of their starter money. This form for roleplay is extremely low effort, scummy, and something that will not be tolerated in this community.
